# Stock Control/Management
  Java MVC stock management application with a connection to a PostgreSQL database. Should include features like users management, item stock tracking, sales reports, POS page, etc. Intended for a small family owned mart.
  
# Pre-requisites
  1. You will need an installation of Postgres and a database management tool. I used PgAdmin as it came with the postgres installation.
  2. You will also need an install of a JDK and JavaFX SDK or just the JavaFX Runtime. This project was developed in Eclipse with e(fx)clipse.

# Installation
  1. Install Eclipse. (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
  2. Download e(fx)clipse and install from Eclipse Marketplace.
  3. Install PostgreSQL along with PgAdmin. (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  4. Create a server on PgAdmin and use the restore tool to give you a test database.
  5. Select the 'backup' file to get the server up and running with some users and items.
  6. Import and run the project in Eclipse.
  7. Log in using the main admin login: User ID: 1001 Password: test
